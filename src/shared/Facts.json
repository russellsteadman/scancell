    "Kombucha, a fermented tea drink, is made from a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast. Yeast produces ethyl alcohol (drinking alcohol), and bacteria converts it to acetic acid (vinegar) and other byproducts.",
    "The binomial name of baking yeast is Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which literally translates to \"sugar-fungus of beer\".",
    "Yeast-leavened bread does not contain alcohol because the baking process causes the volatile alcohol molecules to evaporate."
